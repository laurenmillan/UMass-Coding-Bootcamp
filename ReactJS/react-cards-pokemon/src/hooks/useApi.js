/** Logic for PokeDex.js, Axios API calls.
 * 
 * Since we use axios in a few components, letâ€™s move this logic into a function called useAxios.
 * -useAxios should take in a URL, and similar to useState, it should return an array with two elements. 
 * -The first element is an array of data obtained from previous AJAX requests (since we will add to this array, itâ€™s a piece of state). 
 * -The second element is a function that will add a new object of data to our array.
